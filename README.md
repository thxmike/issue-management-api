# Issue Management API

## Purpose
This is an opinionated RESTFul API which supports basic CRUD operations for Issues. It was built using NodeJS / Express / MongoDb along with some opinionated libraries.

### Schema

- File - This is the metadata of a file and will have the same schema presented by the (File  Management API)[]
    - id - a unique identifier associated to the file
    - name - This is file metadata and will serve as the new file name stored in the system
    - description - this is file metadata and will describe when the file was uploaded.
    - size - this is file metadata and will provide the fiile size in bytes
    - file_id - this is the file id generated by the underlying file system (GridFS)
    - file_name - the original filename when the file was uploaded
    - context_id - the external identifier used for segregating the data.
    - path -  this is file metadat and serves as a virtual file folder and can be used for organization.
    - nonce - used for client side concurrency
    - timestamps
      - deleted - date the item was soft deleted
      - created - date the item was created
      - updated - date the item was updated

There is also a file upload and download process which is the binary data of the file you are taking action of
### Deployment

This can be run as a docker container or directly from the node run time. 
An example Dockerfile has been created to run this application as a container.
An example launch.json and tasks.json files have been included in this project to run the application directly

### Prerequisits

- NodeJS vs 14.6 - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- MongoDB - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

Once NodeJS is installed run the following off the root of the project directory
:
```
npm install 
```

This was built using visual studio code and leverages a launch.json

      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

### Testing

This application has yaml file for leveraging (artillery.io)[https://artillery.io/] 
Once artillery is installed, to run some initial testing the following command can be executed

``
artillery run test/performance/applications.yml --environment local
``
